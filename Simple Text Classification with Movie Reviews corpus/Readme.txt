This is a simple project, where I've basically done text classification on the movie_reviews corpus included in the NLTK library. In these reviews, there are mainly two categories - positive reviews and negative reviews.

So, our goal is to create a model to classify some custom reviews to its respective categories.


The following are the main steps that I've have done:

In the 1st part, I have used the Frequency Distributions method to get the most common words and from these frequent words.
This approach is referred to as the "Top-N words features". With this approach I've created the base model.

In the 2nd part, I've focused on creating bag of words with unigram features only and made a model with them.

In the 3rd part, I've combined both unigram and bigram features in our model.


Overall, I've done NLP text classification with some basic knowledge about NLP tasks.
I'm still learning about various techniques and will try to implement more projects.
